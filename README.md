# Sublime Pretty Shell
Shell Script beautifier plugin for Sublime Text 3.\
Utilizes [mvdan/sh](https://github.com/mvdan/sh).\
\
Recommended for shell scripting beginners.\
I've written this plugin for myself to learn how to write scripts in correct syntax.


# Install
- Make sure you have `shfmt` installed.
- Currently waiting for merge into: [wbond/package_control_channel](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel).
- Til it's done, however, you can also manually install it (on macOS. Should work on Linux too by doing the same thing in the equivalent directory.):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aerobounce/Sublime-Pretty-Shell.git "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/PrettyShell"
```
- And now you're ready, have fun â€” Make sure you restart ST3.
