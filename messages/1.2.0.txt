v1.2.0

🆕 New Features
• Pretty Shell now shows syntax error on format
    • This is quite useful feature, as there are some
      corner syntax errors that shellcheck does not catch but shfmt does.
    • If you are confident enough with your scripting style,
      Pretty Shell might just be enough for you now.
      The shellcheck linter is still recommended for the most people though.

❗️ Removed Feature
• Output Panel is no longer used as it conflicts with SublimeLinter
